## Liri: Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface Project

We will be using terminal to make our commands to liri and getting a response of some sort.

### concert-this
`node liri.js concert-this <artist>`
This will respond using the BandsInTown API and give us the artist we chose upcoming concerts such as **venue name, venue location, and date/time of the event.**
